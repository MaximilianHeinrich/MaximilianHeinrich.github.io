# Introduction to JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is widely used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, as well as for storing configuration data and exchanging data between different programming languages and systems.

## Key Features

- **Human Readable:** JSON data is presented in a format that is easy for humans to read and write, using a combination of key-value pairs and arrays.
- **Lightweight:** JSON is a lightweight format, making it efficient for transmitting data over networks and storing data in files.
- **Language Independent:** JSON is independent of programming languages, making it easy to use with any programming language and platform that supports text-based data exchange.
- **Hierarchical Structure:** JSON supports hierarchical data structures, allowing complex data to be represented in a nested format with objects and arrays.
- **Self-Describing:** JSON data is self-describing, meaning that it includes metadata that describes the structure and type of the data, making it easy to interpret and validate.
- **Support for Basic Data Types:** JSON supports basic data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects, as well as null values.
- **Extensibility:** JSON is extensible, allowing developers to define custom data types and structures using conventions such as JSON Schema.

## Applications of JSON

JSON is used in a wide range of applications and scenarios, including:

- **Web APIs:** JSON is commonly used for transmitting data between a web server and a client application in the form of API responses.
- **Configuration Files:** JSON is used for storing configuration data in applications, such as settings, preferences, and options.
- **Data Exchange:** JSON is used for exchanging data between different systems and platforms, such as between a web application and a database, or between microservices in a distributed system.
- **Serialization:** JSON is used for serializing objects into a string format for storage or transmission, and deserializing JSON strings back into objects.
- **Interoperability:** JSON is used for interoperability between different programming languages and systems, enabling data exchange between systems built with different technologies.
- **Data Storage:** JSON is used for storing data in NoSQL databases, document-oriented databases, and other data storage systems that support JSON as a data format.

## Example Code

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "is_active": true,
  "roles": ["admin", "developer"],
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown",
    "state": "CA",
    "postal_code": "12345"
  }
}
```
